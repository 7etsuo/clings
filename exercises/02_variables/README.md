Topic: Variable declartions

C is a statically typed language, this means that any variable you declare needs to have an associated type.

In this exercise you will see several variable declarations for some primitive data types, however the types are being used on the wrong variable!

Assign the correct types to each variable.

Hint, here are all the primitive data types: 
- character
- integer
- short integer
- long integer
- floating-point
- double-precision floating-point
- long double-precision floating-point
- unsigned integer
- boolean
