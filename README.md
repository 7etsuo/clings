# What is clings?
clings is a C version of the popular program "rustlings" made for the Rust programming language.

The purpose of this program is to take you from a total C noob, to somewhere beyond beginner.

![demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danwritecode/clings/master/demo.gif)

# Dependencies
1. gcc
2. make

You can install everything need (on ubuntu) with:
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

# How do I use it?
1. Clone clings to your local machine
2. Open clings in your favorite text editor
3. Open a terminal session
4. Split your screen so you can view them side by side
5. Compile and start clings 
```
make
```
```
./clings
```
6. Start at exercise_01 and continue from there

# Contributions
I would love to receive contributions for new exercises to be added to clings. This course is designed to take someone from zero understanding of C to something a bit past beginner. 

### Exercise Directory structure
1. README.md file is required
2. N number of ".c" exercises can be included, the program will work through them dynamically
3. At the top of any exercise, provide vague explanation of the objective of the exercise without giving the answer

# To do
1. Rustlings has the concept of asking for a hint, will eventually look to integrate this

### Note
I did this as a project to help me learn C. The source code is far from perfect. I would gladly accept any code reviews and will work to fix any issues that are submitted.
